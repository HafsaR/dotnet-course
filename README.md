Decimal to binary conversion:
-Convert Decimal number to binary digit

Challenge#11: 
 Write a function that takes in a number and a string. Return a substring of the original string of the size of the number.
    Example: Input is "Hello world" and 7. Output should be "Hello w".
    If the number is greater than then length of the string, pad the string with dots so that it matches the length
    Example: Input is "Hello" and 10. Output should be "Hello....."

Challenge#12: 
 Write some code where the user enters two floating point "types" as strings (e.g. decimal, double, float).
    Convert the value 1.234567890 from the first type to the second type. Output the result as a string.

Challenge#14: 
 Write some code that accepts numbers from user input and adds it to a running sum.
    The program exits when the user enters a '0'.
    Example:
    Current Sum: 0
    Enter a number: 5
    Current Sum: 5
    Enter a number: 12
    Current Sum: 17
    Enter a number: -3
    Current Sum: 14
    Enter a number: 0
    Final result: 14   

    challenge#13: 
 Write a function similar to our cat-buying algorithm from unit 1. 
    Input parameters: colour of the cat, gender of the cat, is the cat neutered/spayed
    Return value: boolean - true if we will buy the cat, false if not
    Rules: Cat must be one of the following
    - A male cat that is neutered, and either white or orange
    - A female cat that is neutered (spayed), any color but white
